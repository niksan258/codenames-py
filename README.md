# Codenames python
Python implementation of the game Codenames, done at the last moment :)

## Instructions for starting the game
 - Run `py server.py', which should start the server.
 - Run `py client.py', choose a role and a name. The GUI should open up.

## Alternative if you are lazy
 - Run `start.py` , which would launch a local test game setup consisting of:
    * One red spymaster
    * One blue spymaster
    * 2 red teammates
    * 2 blue teammates
